BUGS:
  - [ ] scoping/ordering should be handled correctly
  - [ ] show enough precision when displaying tree w/ small probabilities
  - [ ] unpacking fails on 'รง'
LIBRARIES:
  - [ ] English nouns
  - [ ] Place for staging libraries before they're released
  - [ ] Documentation for standard libraries
  - [ ] Bundled libraries with `data-files` field of cabal?
DEFICIENCIES:
  - [ ] linter should be more thorough
  - [ ] Improve circular dependency error message
    - [ ] specify what exactly went wrong
    - [ ] Should include location information
    - [ ] error test suite
  - [ ] dependency management should work better
  - [ ] overlapping categories?
FEATURES:
  - [ ] user-defined modifiers
  - [ ] a "perhaps you meant..." think would be quite nice

CODE MAINTENANCE:
  - [ ] use prisms for errors
  - [ ] better test suite, e.g. run `madlang install` on Appveyor.
  - [ ] use a catamorphism + better monad for randomness
  - [ ] monorepo w/ main libraries
  - [ ] test suite for error messages
  - [ ] `strip` should be implemented literally any other way than the current
    implementation
  - [ ] self-updating based on github releases!
CI:
  - [ ] appveyor builds (+ tweet needs travis!)
  - [ ] automatic deploys w/ releases
  - [ ] hlint/weeder on travis
